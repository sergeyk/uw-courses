Starting over in a clean directory again. Want to get to a usable state this weekend.

Installed Edge Rails into vendor/ with git submodule, as in http://woss.name/2008/04/11/using-git-submodules-to-track-vendorrails-2/.

Installed Rspec with
script/plugin install git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec.git
script/plugin install git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails.git
script/generate rspec

Installed (script/plugin install) clear_empty_attributes from http://github.com/collectiveidea/clear_empty_attributes/tree/master.

Installed acts_as_ferret with script/plugin install svn://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/tags/stable/acts_as_ferret.

Installed seed-fu from outdated master branch with script/plugin install git://github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu.git.

Verified that server starts and runs fine. Declared Course and Evaluation models, and ported the specs over. Changed the specs to not rely on fixture-replacement. Verified that specs pass.

Ported over scraping stuff. Put specs for it in spec/lib and verified pass.

Autotest does not work, fails to load hpricot. Don't know why, proceeding with controller development.

Got evaluations controller to be pretty good last night. Today investigated making a departments controller. Reached the conclusion that Department needs to be a database-backed model. Same for Quarter. Will refactor soon, but first going to make an Instructors controller, since that isn't going to be a model, due to the variation in name format. Although I'm coming to realize that I will need an instructor model to standardize formatting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally got autotest working. Solution: listed 'hpricot' and 'haml' as required gems in environment.rb and gems:unpack'ed them. Now that autotest is running, time for refactoring of model code.

Made Scores into its own model. Took a while, because the way serialize works is not how I thought it would work: it tries to serialize before any before_validation methods are called. So, I couldn't convert to Scores from Hash before serialize had a problem. After some time, the solution is to cast the incoming data to Scores. Clunky, but I'm tired of this.

Also, autotest now growl-notifies. Got working following the tutorial at http://www.gluedtomyseat.com/2008/5/12/configuring-autotest-and-growl-in-osx-leopard.

Discovered something disconcerting: in evals_uptospring08_1 file, there are at least two ITAL 134 B in SUM2007. That's a big problem, because those 4 attributes are the constraints on my seed-fu seeding. I guess instructor name should also be a constraint. Shit, it'll take some processing to adjust these big files. For now, I'm seeding the first file as is. Also, a lot of evals are failing because of bad section ('02') or not enough eval information. I modified the seed-fu code to not stop rake on failed model save!'s. I'm going to try and put some controller work in before going to bed.

Man, before doing anything else tomorrow, got to write specs for the Scores and Instructor classes!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 13 03:33:06 -0700 2008
Actually, never mind, wrote most of the spec for Instructor, and Scores doesn't need much at all. Finish up the Instructor one, and then work on controllers tomorrow.

It took a good hour and a half, but Instructor is fully spec'd out. Refactored averages computation in the process. Also worked a little on the controller. NEED to implement will_paginate and search soon: horrendously slow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put in some work on the controllers. Changed find_by_instructor_name method to accept standard find() options hash. Should probably spec a little bit, although it's part of the acts_as_ferret functionality. Also look at TODOs in Evaluation and AbstractCourse to spec, and also consider refactoring Instructor: add rating methods to Evaluation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 16 14:44:35 -0700 2008
TODO: refactor specs for Instructor class: average ratings things should be spec'd in separate file, as that is shared functionality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put in some work on the view side, but didn't do the TODO above. Enabling caching makes everything hella fast.
puts "-"*80; puts Time.new
