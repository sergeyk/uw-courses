Verified that server starts and runs fine. Declared Course and Evaluation models, and ported the specs over. Changed the specs to not rely on fixture-replacement. Verified that specs pass.

Ported over scraping stuff. Put specs for it in spec/lib and verified pass.

Autotest does not work, fails to load hpricot. Don't know why, proceeding with controller development.

Got evaluations controller to be pretty good last night. Today investigated making a departments controller. Reached the conclusion that Department needs to be a database-backed model. Same for Quarter. Will refactor soon, but first going to make an Instructors controller, since that isn't going to be a model, due to the variation in name format. Although I'm coming to realize that I will need an instructor model to standardize formatting.

Finally got autotest working. Solution: listed 'hpricot' and 'haml' as required gems in environment.rb and gems:unpack'ed them. Now that autotest is running, time for refactoring of model code.

Made Scores into its own model. Took a while, because the way serialize works is not how I thought it would work: it tries to serialize before any before_validation methods are called. So, I couldn't convert to Scores from Hash before serialize had a problem. After some time, the solution is to cast the incoming data to Scores. Clunky, but I'm tired of this.

puts "-"*80; puts Time.new
