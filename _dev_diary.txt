Starting over in a clean directory again. Want to get to a usable state this weekend.

Installed Edge Rails into vendor/ with git submodule, as in http://woss.name/2008/04/11/using-git-submodules-to-track-vendorrails-2/.

Installed Rspec with
script/plugin install git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec.git
script/plugin install git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails.git
script/generate rspec
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installed (script/plugin install) clear_empty_attributes from http://github.com/collectiveidea/clear_empty_attributes/tree/master.

Installed acts_as_ferret with script/plugin install svn://projects.jkraemer.net/acts_as_ferret/tags/stable/acts_as_ferret.

Installed seed-fu from outdated master branch with script/plugin install git://github.com/mbleigh/seed-fu.git.

Verified that server starts and runs fine. Declared Course and Evaluation models, and ported the specs over. Changed the specs to not rely on fixture-replacement. Verified that specs pass.

Ported over scraping stuff. Put specs for it in spec/lib and verified pass.

Autotest does not work, fails to load hpricot. Don't know why, proceeding with controller development.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got evaluations controller to be pretty good last night. Today investigated making a departments controller. Reached the conclusion that Department needs to be a database-backed model. Same for Quarter. Will refactor soon, but first going to make an Instructors controller, since that isn't going to be a model, due to the variation in name format. Although I'm coming to realize that I will need an instructor model to standardize formatting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Aug 10 16:14:25 -0700 2008
Finally got autotest working. Solution: listed 'hpricot' and 'haml' as required gems in environment.rb and gems:unpack'ed them. Now that autotest is running, time for refactoring of model code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Made Scores into its own model. Took a while, because the way serialize works is not how I thought it would work: it tries to serialize before any before_validation methods are called. So, I couldn't convert to Scores from Hash before serialize had a problem. After some time, the solution is to cast the incoming data to Scores. Clunky, but I'm tired of this.

Also, autotest now growl-notifies. Got working following the tutorial at http://www.gluedtomyseat.com/2008/5/12/configuring-autotest-and-growl-in-osx-leopard.

Discovered something disconcerting: in evals_uptospring08_1 file, there are at least two ITAL 134 B in SUM2007. That's a big problem, because those 4 attributes are the constraints on my seed-fu seeding. I guess instructor name should also be a constraint. Shit, it'll take some processing to adjust these big files. For now, I'm seeding the first file as is. Also, a lot of evals are failing because of bad section ('02') or not enough eval information. I modified the seed-fu code to not stop rake on failed model save!'s. I'm going to try and put some controller work in before going to bed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 13 02:03:00 -0700 2008
Man, before doing anything else tomorrow, got to write specs for the Scores and Instructor classes!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 13 03:33:06 -0700 2008
Actually, never mind, wrote most of the spec for Instructor, and Scores doesn't need much at all. Finish up the Instructor one, and then work on controllers tomorrow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 14 02:33:08 -0700 2008
It took a good hour and a half, but Instructor is fully spec'd out. Refactored averages computation in the process. Also worked a little on the controller. NEED to implement will_paginate and search soon: horrendously slow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 15 01:43:18 -0700 2008
Put in some work on the controllers. Changed find_by_instructor_name method to accept standard find() options hash. Should probably spec a little bit, although it's part of the acts_as_ferret functionality. Also look at TODOs in Evaluation and AbstractCourse to spec, and also consider refactoring Instructor: add rating methods to Evaluation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Aug 16 14:44:35 -0700 2008
TODO: refactor specs for Instructor class: average ratings things should be spec'd in separate file, as that is shared functionality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 26 03:37:56 -0700 2008
Put in some work on the view side, but didn't do the TODO above. Enabling caching makes everything hella fast.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Aug 28 01:25:20 -0700 2008
TODO: spec out CourseTitle.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 01 13:52:24 -0700 2008
Today I intend to implement searching, and get a live site running on my Joyent FB accelerator host.
Today TODOs:
 V* compose a small development db data set so i can test overall averages without waiting hours
 V* work on search functionality
 V* work on pagination
 V* search should return not evaluations but Instructors and CourseTitles
 * work on comparisons to overall averages functionality
 * get rails working on Joyent, and deploy site there.
Also, implemented nicer-looking URLs through use of to_param. TODO: spec to_param
 
Later TODOs:
 * refactor specs for the average ratings module.
 * go through everything in models and spec it out--shouldn't be much
 * spec out controller stuff
 
v.2 functionality:
 * better statistics, like histograms and percentiles (this instructor is in the 90th percentile for his department, 40th percentile for this course.)
 * sortable columns: see classes sorted by grading rating
 * search by current quarter sln
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 02 03:28:15 -0700 2008
WEll I did a lot of work today, and got search working (http://railscasts.com/episodes/37 was a big help) and the site looking nice. Pagination is still not implemented, working on that now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 02 06:06:59 -0700 2008
Goddamn it's late, but everything is mostly done. Now all that's left is to deploy somewhere and populate. And to put GOogle analytics, and to get a domain name. Will get a domain name right now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 04 00:01:32 -0700 2008
Got a domain name (through bluehost.com, $10), and also registered for Slicehost (3 months, $60). Spent the past couple of hours setting up my slice and getting Passenger working. Appears to be working, but ferret is fucking up in production--required Dbruby server or something; I don't think using it is worth it, so I think I'll switch to just sql search now.
It is a lot of work, but I'm doing it. A HIGH priority
TODO: go through the model specs, and revise/add more.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 04 01:20:26 -0700 2008
Woo! App up and running on uwcourses.com. Now must fix up locally, push, and populate database. Will populate database right now, I guess. Alright, it's chugging along. Just registered fro a Google Analytics account under my sergeykarayev account, called uwcourses. Should set up adsense pretty soon, too, and register uwcourses@gmail.com.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Somehow these things always take way longer than I expect. Did major redesign to use class caching of everything: should be blazing fast even with 30K evals now. In the process, had complete disregard for good style, DRYness, and ruby tricks. MUST go through and clean up later.
